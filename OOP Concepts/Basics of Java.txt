 55**JDK**
JDK stands for java development kit.
it is a software for running java programs.

**JRE**
JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment
JRE is a software environment that allows Java programs to be executed on any device that has a JRE installed.

**JIT**
JIT stands for Just-In-Time. It is a type of compiler that compiles bytecode into machine code at runtime.

**features of Java**

Simple
Object-Oriented
Portable
Platform independent
Secured
Robust

Architecture neutral
Interpreted
High Performance
Multithreaded
Distributed
Dynamic

Simple: 
Java is very easy to learn, and its syntax is simple, clean and easy to understand.

Object-oriented: 
Object-oriented programming (OOPs) is a methodology that simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some rules.

Platform Independent: 
Java is platform-independent because it is compiled to a bytecode that can be run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 

Secured: 
Java is best known for its security.  Java is secured because: No explicit pointer

Portable: 
Java is portable because it facilitates you to carry the Java bytecode to any platform.

**What is the Java bytecode**
Byte Code can be defined as an intermediate code generated by the compiler after the compilation of source code(JAVA Program). This intermediate code makes Java a platform-independent language.
The extension of a Java bytecode file is .class
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the software that runs Java bytecode on a device.

**types of error in java**
there are three types of errors in java : 
1)syntax error
The error detected by the compiler are called syntax error or compile error

2)Run Time error
The Run time error that occur during the execution of program is called run time error

3)Logic error
These occur when the program is executing correctly, but the result is not what was intended. 

**java garbage collector**

Java does not support Destructor to free up the memory. For that java support Garbage Collection 	

A Java runtime environment delete object periodically when it determine that they are no longer being used. This process is known as Garbage Collection.

**Array**
An array is a collection of similar type of elements which has contiguous memory location.
We can store only a fixed set of elements in a Java array.
Array is store in the form of index based. index start with 0. 

Advantages: Code Optimization , Random access
Disadvantages: Size Limit

There are two types of array.

1.Single Dimensional Array

class Testarray{  
public static void main(String args[]){  
int a[]=new int[5];  
a[0]=10;  
a[1]=20;  
a[2]=70;  
a[3]=40;  
a[4]=50;  
//traversing array  
for(int i=0;i<a.length;i++)
System.out.println(a[i]);  
}
}  

2.Multidimensional Array

data is stored in row and column based index (also known as matrix form).

methods of array are : sort() , Equals() , copyOf()

**Command Line Arguments** 
The command line argument allows us to pass the argument to the main method from command line. 
The main method of java program has the parameter args[] String type. this is basically an array of string. 
you can pass String to a main method using cammand line when you run program. 

public class pra_2 {
    public static void main(String args[]){
        System.out.println("you Enter arguments: ");
        for(int i=0; i<5; i++){
            System.out.println(args[0]);
        }
    }
}

output : 
java prac_2   hello how are you 
you ente arguments: 
hello //args[0]
how  //args[1]
are  //args[2]
you  //args[3]
