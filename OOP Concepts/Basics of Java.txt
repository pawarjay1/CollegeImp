**JDK**
JDK stands for java development kit.
it is a software for running java programs.

**JRE**
JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment
JRE is a software environment that allows Java programs to be executed on any device that has a JRE installed.

**JIT**
JIT stands for Just-In-Time. It is a type of compiler that compiles bytecode into machine code at runtime.

**features of Java**

Simple
Object-Oriented
Portable
Platform independent
Secured
Robust

Architecture neutral
Interpreted
High Performance
Multithreaded
Distributed
Dynamic

Simple: 
Java is very easy to learn, and its syntax is simple, clean and easy to understand.

Object-oriented: 
Object-oriented programming (OOPs) is a methodology that simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some rules.

Platform Independent: 
Java is platform-independent because it is compiled to a bytecode that can be run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 

Secured: 
Java is best known for its security.  Java is secured because: No explicit pointer

Portable: 
Java is portable because it facilitates you to carry the Java bytecode to any platform.

**What is the Java bytecode**
Byte Code can be defined as an intermediate code generated by the compiler after the compilation of source code(JAVA Program). This intermediate code makes Java a platform-independent language.
The extension of a Java bytecode file is .class
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the software that runs Java bytecode on a device.

**types of error in java**
there are three types of errors in java : 
1)syntax error
The error detected by the compiler are called syntax error or compile error

2)Run Time error
The Run time error that occur during the execution of program is called run time error

3)Logic error
These occur when the program is executing correctly, but the result is not what was intended.
