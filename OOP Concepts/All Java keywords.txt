**import**
import keyword is used to import the built-in and user-defined packages, class or interface in Java. 

**new** 
The new keyword is used to create an instance of a class, also known as an object. 
The new keyword in Java is used to allocate memory for the object on the heap, the memory space where objects are stored.

**break**
break statement is used to break loop or switch statement.
It breaks the current flow of the program at specified condition. 
We can use Java break statement in all types of loops such as for loop, while loop and do-while loop.

public class BreakExample {  
	public static void main(String[] args) {  
      
    	for(int i=1;i<=10;i++){  
           if(i==5){    
              break;  
            }  
          System.out.println(i);  
       }  
   }  
}

ouput : 1234

**continue**
The continue keyword is used to end the current iteration in a for loop (or a while loop), and continues to the next iteration.

public class ContinueExample {
public static void main(String[] args) {
        for(int i=1;i<=10;i++){
    	if(i==5){
    		continue;    	}
    	System.out.println(i);
    }
}
}
output: 1234678910
