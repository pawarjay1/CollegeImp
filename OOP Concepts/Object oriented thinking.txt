**Encapsulation**
Encapsulation is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit.
We can create a fully encapsulated class in Java by making all the data members of the class private.
Now we can use setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it.

**Abstraction**
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

**Access Modifiers**
The access modifiers in Java specifies the accessibility or scope of a field, method, constructor, or class.

Private: The access level of a private modifier is only within the class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class.

Default: The access level of a default modifier is only within the package. It cannot be accessed from outside the package. If you do not specify any access level, it will be the default.

Protected: The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and outside the package through child class. If you do not make the child class, it cannot be accessed from outside the package.

Public: The access level of a public modifier is everywhere. It can be accessed from within the class, outside the class, within the package and outside the package.

**Define object oriented concepts.**
the main purpose of oop is to deal with real world entity using programming language. 

-class: 
collection of objects is called class. 
class does not consume any space. 
A class also known as bleuprint.

there are two types of class. 
1.pre-define: Scanner,console,System,String etc.
2.user define

-object: 
object is an instance of class 

-Inheritance: 
Inheritance is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and bbehaviors of parent objects. 

-polymorphism: 
if one task is performed in different ways is known as polymorphism. 
In java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achive polymorphism. 

-absraction: 
hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. 
In java we use abstraction class & Interface to achive abstraction.

-Encapsulation: 
binding code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation.
