**object**
An object is an instance of a class that represents a real-world entity.

**class**
class is a blueprint or template that determines the structure and behavior of objects

**constructor** 

Defination: The constructor is a specialized method for initializing objects.

Constructor name is same as its class name.
Constructor is a special Type of method.
Constructor does not have any return type not even Void.

Whenever an object of the associated class is created, the constuctor is invoked automatically 

Rules for creating Java constructor
1.Constructor name must be the same as its class name
2.A Constructor must have no explicit return type
3.A Java constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, and synchronized

there are three types of constructor
1.Default Constructor : 
When user does not define any type of Constructor then Java create System define constructor which is known as Default Constructor.
The default constructor is used to provide the default values to the object like 0, null, etc.

For example : 
class Student3
{  
	int id;  
	String name;  
	//method to display the value of id and name  
	void display(){System.out.println(id+" "+name);}  
  
	public static void main(String args[]){  
		//creating objects  
		Student3 s1=new Student3();  
		Student3 s2=new Student3();  
		//displaying values of the object  
		s1.display();  
		s2.display();  
	}  
}  

output : 0 Null


2.Parameterized Constructor : 
When we pass argument in Constructor then it is known as Parameterized Constructor.

For example : 
class Student4{  
    int id;  
    String name;  
    
    Student4(int i,String n){  
    id = i;  
    name = n;  
    }  
    
    void display(){System.out.println(id+" "+name);}  
   
    public static void main(String args[]){  
    
    Student4 s1 = new Student4(111,"Karan");  
    Student4 s2 = new Student4(222,"Aryan");  
      
    s1.display();  
    s2.display();  
   }  
} 

3.Copy Constructor : 
Copy Constructor copy the state (date) of one object to another object.

For example: 
class Student6{  
    int id;  
    String name;  
    //constructor to initialize integer and string  
    Student6(int i,String n){  
    id = i;  
    name = n;  
    }  
    //constructor to initialize another object  
    Student6(Student6 s){  
    id = s.id;  
    name =s.name;  
    }  
    void display(){System.out.println(id+" "+name);}  
   
    public static void main(String args[]){  
    Student6 s1 = new Student6(111,"Karan");  
    Student6 s2 = new Student6(s1);  
    s1.display();  
    s2.display();  
   }  
}
